# IMPORTANT: Microsoft Graph Module Issue

## Problem
The Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (v2.30.0) has a parsing bug that causes this error:
```
The string is missing the terminator: '.
```

This is a known issue with the module's internal script loading mechanism.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Reinstall Graph Module
```powershell
# Uninstall current version
Uninstall-Module Microsoft.Graph -AllVersions -Force

# Install a specific version known to work
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -RequiredVersion 2.24.0 -Force
```

### Option 2: Use the Direct Script
We've created `SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1` which works around the issue:
```powershell
.\SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1 -SiteUrl "https://yoursite.sharepoint.com" -LibraryName "Documents" -ModifiedDate "2025-01-15"
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix
The issue is in the Graph module's internal files. You can try:
1. Navigate to the Graph module folder
2. Find files with malformed quotes
3. Fix the syntax errors

### Option 4: Use Original PnP Version
The original PnP.PowerShell version (in parent folder) still works but requires Azure CLI client ID workaround.

## Status
- **Module Version**: Microsoft.Graph 2.30.0
- **Issue**: Internal parsing error in module scripts
- **Impact**: Cannot load Graph cmdlets properly
- **Workaround**: Use SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1

## Notes
This is not an issue with our code but with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK itself. Microsoft is aware of such issues and they typically get fixed in newer releases.
