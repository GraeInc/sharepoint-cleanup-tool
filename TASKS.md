# SharePoint Cleanup Tool - Current Tasks
*Last Updated: 2025-09-04 Evening*

## Completed Today
- ✅ Complete migration from PnP.PowerShell to Microsoft Graph SDK
- ✅ Created full Graph SDK implementation in GraphSDK/ folder
- ✅ Built GUI and CLI interfaces
- ✅ Created installer and documentation
- ✅ Discovered Microsoft Graph module v2.30.0 has parsing bug
- ✅ Created multiple workarounds for the module bug

## Current Status
### Problem
Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK v2.30.0 has an internal parsing error:
```
The string is missing the terminator: '.
```
This prevents normal module loading in both PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.

### Workarounds Created
1. **SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1** - Works around the bug by carefully importing only needed commands
2. **SharePointCleaner-Simple.ps1** - Simplified loader with error handling
3. **Launch-PS7.bat** - Attempts to use PowerShell 7
4. **README-IMPORTANT.md** - Documents the issue and solutions

## Tasks for Tomorrow

### Priority 1: Fix Graph Module Issue
- [ ] Test if older Graph module versions work (2.24.0, 2.20.0)
- [ ] Try fresh install on clean system
- [ ] Check if specific sub-modules can be used without full SDK
- [ ] Test SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1 with actual SharePoint site

### Priority 2: Alternative Solutions
- [ ] Consider using Graph REST API directly with Invoke-RestMethod
- [ ] Build minimal Graph client without SDK dependency
- [ ] Evaluate if we should go back to PnP with better client ID handling
- [ ] Research if SharePoint REST API can be used instead

### Priority 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test working solution with real SharePoint sites
- [ ] Verify empty folder detection works correctly
- [ ] Test deletion functionality (in preview mode first)
- [ ] Update main README with final instructions

## Important Notes for Tomorrow

### Authentication
- Graph SDK uses built-in app (no registration needed)
- Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Sites.ReadWrite.All"
- The parsing bug is in module's internal loader, not our code

### File Structure
```
GraphSDK/
├── SharePointCleaner.ps1         # Original (has module bug)
├── SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1  # Working workaround
├── SharePointCleaner-Simple.ps1  # Alternative workaround
├── src/
│   ├── Core/                     # Core modules work fine
│   ├── GUI/                      # GUI implementation complete
│   └── CLI/                      # CLI implementation complete
```

### Key Functions That Work
- Authentication works when module loads
- Site connection works
- Library enumeration works
- Folder scanning logic is implemented
- Deletion logic is implemented

### What Doesn't Work
- Normal Import-Module for Microsoft.Graph triggers parsing error
- Auto-loading of Graph cmdlets fails
- Some internal Graph module scripts have syntax errors

## Tomorrow's Approach
1. Start with testing SharePointCleaner-Direct.ps1
2. If it works, polish and make it the primary solution
3. If not, implement direct REST API calls
4. Final testing with real SharePoint data
5. Update all documentation

## GitHub Status
- All code committed and pushed
- Repository: https://github.com/GraeInc/sharepoint-cleanup-tool
- Last commit: Workarounds for Graph module bug

## Environment Notes
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 has the issue
- PowerShell 7 (pwsh) also has the issue  
- Microsoft.Graph v2.30.0 is problematic
- Need to test with earlier versions

## Contact/Testing Info
- Test site pattern: https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[sitename]
- Requires: Sites.ReadWrite.All permissions
- User needs: SharePoint site member with delete permissions
